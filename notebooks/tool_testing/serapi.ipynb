       "  'description': \"A visit to Islamabad Serena Hotel is more than just a comfortable stay at the only 5-star deluxe hotel in Pakistan, an affiliated member of the Leading Hotels of the World. It is a vivid immersion into the culture, heritage and lifestyles of Pakistan’s capital, a relatively undiscovered city boasting exhilarating scenery as well as some of the most colourful musical and culinary traditions in the world. Our Islamabad hotel is tucked into a peaceful, 14-acre garden setting between the Margalla Hills and Rawal Lake, framed by Islamic architecture and al fresco terraces and pavilions. Remaining faithful to traditional aesthetics with furniture and design flourishes handcrafted by local artisans, its timeless interiors have been curated to preserve a superb level of comfort. The experience is enhanced by outstanding Moorish architecture and ambience that revive old Islamic civilization and reflect the cultural heritage of Pakistan. Relax in style with the hotel's diverse collection of rooms and suites, where the locally inspired décor is seamlessly infused with modern amenities to ensure a stay in Islamabad that will be opulent yet eminently inviting. Pamper yourself at Maisha Spa, a beautifully designed haven of serenity with signature therapies such as a basil mint scrub or an innovative Thalgo facial, then indulge in an invigorating ice shower before enjoying a healthy lunch by the pool. Views of the Islamabad skyline and tree-draped hills in the distance create a dramatic backdrop from the rooftop pool. Al-Maghreb is our exotic restaurant, showcasing creative Moroccan and Lebanese cuisine. Savour delightful water garden views while dining at Zamana, or visit Dawat to sample enticing treats whilst listening to traditional instruments and live Ghazals. Discover a gateway to the authentic Islamabad at Islamabad Serena Hotel.\",\n",
